## 🗺️ **Why Spatial Coordinates Are Missing**

Unlike traditional spatial transcriptomics analyses, this pipeline uses **UMAP embeddings instead of physical tissue coordinates** for several important reasons:

### **Biological Rationale**
- **Cross-sample Comparison**: Physical coordinates are sample-specific and cannot be directly compared across different tissue sections
- **Functional Organization**: UMAP coordinates represent biological similarity rather than physical proximity
- **Zonation Analysis**: Liver zonation is better represented in functional space than physical space
- **Integration Focus**: The goal is to integrate biological patterns, not reconstruct tissue morphology

### **Technical Advantages**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: UMAP provides optimal 2D representation of high-dimensional gene expression
- **Batch Correction**: Integration algorithms work on expression space, not physical coordinates
- **Comparative Analysis**: Enables direct comparison of biological zones across samples
- **Visualization**: UMAP coordinates reveal functional organization patterns

### **Analysis Implications**
- **Spatial Analysis**: Focus on biological neighborhoods rather than geometric proximity
- **Zonation Mapping**: Zones are defined by expression similarity, not physical location
- **Integration Success**: Measured by biological pattern preservation, not spatial reconstruction

## 🔬 **Key Biological Concepts Explained**

### **Liver Zonation Analysis**
**Definition**: The systematic spatial organization of hepatocytes with different metabolic functions across the liver lobule.

**Biological Zones**:
- **Periportal (Zone 1)**: Near portal vein; oxidative metabolism, gluconeogenesis
- **Mid (Zone 2)**: Intermediate metabolic zone; mixed functions
- **Central (Zone 3)**: Near central vein; glycolysis, lipogenesis, detoxification
- **Portal**: Portal tract regions containing blood vessels and bile ducts

**Scientific Importance**: Liver zonation reflects functional specialization and is disrupted in disease states.

### **Zonation Groups vs. Continuous Zonation**
- **Zonation Groups**: Discrete categories (Periportal, Mid, Central, Portal) for easy interpretation
- **Continuous Zonation**: Numerical score (0.0-1.0) representing gradient from portal to central regions
- **Biological Reality**: Liver zonation exists as a continuous gradient with discrete functional domains

### **Multi-Modal Analysis (RNA + Protein)**
**Concept**: Simultaneous measurement of gene expression (RNA) and protein abundance (ADTs) from the same tissue spots.

**Advantages**:
- **Functional Validation**: Protein levels confirm RNA expression patterns
- **Enhanced Resolution**: Protein markers provide additional cellular identity information
- **Spatial Co-localization**: Maps where specific proteins and genes are expressed together
- **Cell Type Identification**: Immune cell markers (CD4, CD8a, CD19) identify infiltrating populations

### **Antibody-Derived Tags (ADTs)**
**Technology**: Oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies that enable protein quantification alongside RNA sequencing.

**Key Markers in Dataset**:
- **Immune Markers**: CD4, CD8a, CD19, CD3e (T cells, B cells)
- **Myeloid Markers**: CD11b, F4/80, CD11c (macrophages, dendritic cells)
- **Functional Markers**: CD44, CD73, CD71 (activation, metabolism)
- **Structural Markers**: CD31, CD326 (endothelial, epithelial cells)
